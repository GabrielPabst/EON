### **1. The QA Engineer and the Never-Ending Updates (EON Basic)**

Sarah works as a QA engineer in a mid-sized software company. Every week, her team releases a new build of their web application — and every week, she has to manually test all the interface elements to make sure nothing broke. Buttons move slightly, forms shift by a few pixels, and icons sometimes get replaced.

She starts using **EON Basic** to record her workflow once: logging in, navigating through pages, and clicking on key features. The next week, when she replays the automation, the interface has shifted slightly — but EON recognizes the new placements instantly. It doesn’t break or freeze like traditional recorders. Instead, it adapts visually and keeps running.

What used to take hours of repetitive clicking now takes ten minutes. EON Basic saves Sarah’s team dozens of hours per sprint, freeing them to focus on the actual testing, not the navigation.

### **2. The Logistics Manager Who Automated the Inbox (EON Context Mode)**

David runs operations for a logistics company that handles thousands of shipments per week. Each morning, he receives dozens of emails with slightly different layouts — shipping confirmations, customs updates, and client status requests. His assistants used to spend hours manually copying data into their ERP system.

When David installs **EON**, he finds a pre-built macro that extracts data from emails and enters it into the ERP. That worked well — until one of their partners changed their email format completely. Instead of breaking, **EON Context Mode** adapts. David had already given it the rule “identify shipment IDs and delivery dates even if the format changes.”

EON understands the context: it recognizes that a “delivery date” might now appear in a different sentence or position. It updates its logic on the fly, using the Basic engine to still click and copy the right fields.

The result: his workflow continues uninterrupted through every formatting change. David’s team no longer worries about software updates or partner inconsistencies — EON simply *understands* what they’re trying to do.

### **3. The Design Agency’s Multi-Resolution Challenge (EON Basic)**

A UX testing agency works for international clients, testing websites across multiple devices and resolutions. Their testers constantly had to redo recordings every time they switched from a 1080p screen to a 4K one, because most automation tools fail when the layout changes slightly.

With **EON Basic**, they record their test sequence once — scrolling through the product gallery, checking image visibility, clicking buttons. When they replay it on another computer, the macro doesn’t fail. It recognizes that certain buttons are now slightly smaller or located a few centimeters to the right and moves the cursor accordingly.

The agency was amazed. For the first time, one automation workflow worked on every resolution and window size. What once required 6 versions of the same test now runs perfectly with one single macro. EON doesn’t just repeat clicks — it *understands placement.*

### **4. The Automation Studio That Sold Adaptability (EON Context Mode)**

A small startup specializing in process automation wanted to expand its reach. They built powerful Python-based macros for clients — but every time a client’s software changed, their scripts broke.

After switching to **EON**, they began designing macros with **Context Mode**. Instead of recording fixed clicks, they built adaptive automations. Their “Excel Report Builder” macro not only finds the right buttons using Basic recognition but also understands the structure of the report: if new columns appear, EON Context identifies them as “extra data,” not as an error. It adjusts formulas and exports accordingly.

They list the macro on EON’s marketplace as “Context-Aware Automation for Evolving Data.” Clients love that it doesn’t just survive interface updates — it adapts intelligently.

### **5. The Student Who Automated Her Creative Routine (EON Basic)**

Lisa studies media design and spends hours preparing her workspace every day — opening folders, sorting files, launching editing software, and cleaning up old assets. None of it is complicated, but it eats up her creative time.

She installs **EON Basic** and records a single macro: it opens her main project folder, sorts files by date, moves yesterday’s exports into an archive, and then launches her editing suite. Even when she rearranges her desktop or renames folders, EON recognizes the new layout and continues to execute flawlessly.

Now, when Lisa sits down to work, she just presses one hotkey. Her entire setup is ready in seconds. She doesn’t need coding knowledge or AI — just EON Basic quietly automating her daily routine.

### **6. The Gamer Who Never Missed a Reward (EON Basic)**

Tom is a gamer and streamer who plays a strategy game with repetitive daily tasks — collecting rewards, opening chests, clicking the same buttons hundreds of times. He uses **EON Basic** to record a macro that does all that automatically.

When the developers release an update that slightly moves the buttons and changes the colors, other macro tools fail completely. EON doesn’t. It detects that the “Collect” and “Confirm” buttons are the same elements in new positions. Tom doesn’t have to adjust anything — his automation still works.

While his friends are still clicking, Tom is already live on stream, laughing about how his macro “plays the boring part” for him. It’s small, but it’s the kind of everyday magic that makes EON feel alive on your desktop.

### **7. The Freelancer and the Ever-Changing Forms (EON Context Mode)**

Anna is a freelancer who fills out a dozen different PDF forms every week — client contracts, invoices, NDAs. Every template looks slightly different. Her old automation tools kept breaking because they only recognized positions, not meanings.

With **EON Context Mode**, Anna records her automation once and tells EON what each field represents: “this is the name field,” “this is the project title,” “this is the total price.” When she receives a new contract layout, EON uses that context to find the right fields, even if they’ve moved or been renamed. It understands that “Total Amount Due” is the same as “Total Fee.”

EON then uses its Basic engine to fill and sign the form perfectly, no matter how the template looks. For Anna, this feels less like automation and more like having an assistant who actually *understands* her work.

### **8. The Small Business Owner Who Built His Own System (EON Context Mode)**

Mark owns a small photography business and hates doing invoices. He’s not technical, but he tries EON’s no-code editor. He builds a workflow that takes data from an Excel sheet and fills it into email templates.

At first, it’s simple — **EON Basic** handles clicks and text boxes. But over time, Mark’s invoice format changes: new columns appear, prices are formatted differently, and email text varies by client. Instead of re-recording the whole thing, Mark upgrades the macro to **EON Context Mode** and gives it rules like “the ‘amount due’ is always the last number in the table” and “add payment method if missing.”

Now, EON understands his intent. It finds the right values regardless of layout changes, automatically fills out the message, attaches the invoice, and hits send. Mark tells his colleagues: “It’s like having a personal assistant who reads your mind — only it never forgets or gets tired.”
